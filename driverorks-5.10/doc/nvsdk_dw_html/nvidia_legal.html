<p ><a class="anchor" id="dwx_nvidia_legal_automotive_end_user_license_agreement_for_development_license_1_1"></a>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense to: <br  />
 (a) install, use and make copies of the SOFTWARE licensed solely for test and development of your applications and systems that run on compatible NVIDIA devices, and not for use in production; <br  />
 (b) modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SOFTWARE; <br  />
 (c) access and use software update services to install software in your systems that run on compatible NVIDIA devices. The following applies to the software update services: <br  />
 (i) You are responsible for following the software update services instructions provided, including the safety instructions; <br  />
 (ii) It is your choice when and how to update NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA software. As part of the process of selecting systems to update using the software update services, NVIDIA will collect information as described in this Agreement to identify systems that run on compatible NVIDIA devices; <br  />

 (d) if you obtain NVIDIA's written approval (email approval being sufficient), which is provided on a case-by-case basis at NVIDIA's discretion, you may demonstrate the SOFTWARE in binary format as incorporates into your product to third parties, and such approval to demonstrate under this Agreement does not constitute a license to distribute the SOFTWARE.

<p >The SOFTWARE versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software, services and materials. Use of a pre-release SOFTWARE may result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss. You may use pre-release SOFTWARE at your own risk, understanding that it is not intended for use in production or business-critical systems. As with any software or service in pre-release, it is highly recommended that you maintain full data backups for all your software and data. NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release SOFTWARE. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate their availability at any time without liability.</p>
<p >1.4 Updates</p>
<p >NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this SOFTWARE. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the SOFTWARE licensed to you as provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p >With respect to software update services, NVIDIA may at any time change, discontinue, or deprecate any part, or all, of the services, or change or remove features or functionality of the services, and your continued use of the services is deemed acceptance of such changes. Additionally, the services which use NVIDIA servers may be temporarily unavailable or slow when NVIDIA is performing maintenance or upgrades.</p>
