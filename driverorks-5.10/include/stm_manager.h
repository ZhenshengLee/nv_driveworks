 * \brief STM Runtime
 *
 * Overview:
 * STM is a co-operative, non-preemptive, static scheduling framework for real-time systems.
 * The STM runtime is a library that executes a schedule produced offline by the STM compiler, enforcing
 * data dependency ordering and control flow ordering across engines on a Tegra SoC.
 *
 * STM Manager:
 * Manager correspond to a single process controlling schedule execution. Manager is expected to launch and connect with
 * Master before any Client connect to Master.
 *
 * STM Master:
 * Alongside STM clients, STM master expects a Manager process to connect with it. STM Manager will block at the call 
 * to stmScheduleManagerInit() until the STM master process has been launched.
